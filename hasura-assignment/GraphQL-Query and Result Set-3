Get all albums for artist id = 5 without specifying a where clause?

Created a seperate role and utilized it in the request headers and relied on permission settings to automatically filter the data and set the permissionscorrectly for the artists and albums tables.

Query - 

query albumartistid5 {
  album {
    album_id
    title
  }
}



Output -

{
  "data": {
    "album": [
      {
        "album_id": 7,
        "title": "Facelift"
      }
    ]
  }
}
